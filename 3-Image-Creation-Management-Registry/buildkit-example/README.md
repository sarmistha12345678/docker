# BuildKit Example commands 

This repository demonstrates the usage of Docker BuildKit to build and run a Docker image.

## What is Docker BuildKit?

Docker BuildKit is a modern, high-performance builder toolkit for Docker images. It improves the build process by introducing features such as:

- Concurrent building of multiple layers
- Advanced layer caching
- More efficient storage management
- Support for new Dockerfile features and syntax

BuildKit is designed to work with the current Dockerfile format but also enables the possibility of creating new frontend build systems with different syntax and features.


## Prerequisites

- Docker (with BuildKit enabled)

## Enabling BuildKit

To enable BuildKit, set the `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` environment variable to `1`:

```
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```
### Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, run the following command:


```

docker build -t buildkit-example .
```

This command builds a Docker image with the tag buildkit-example using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

#### Running the Docker Container
To run the Docker container, execute the following command:


```


docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name buildkit-example-container buildkit-example
```

- This command runs the buildkit-example image in a container named buildkit-example-container. It also maps the container's port 3000 to the host's port 3000.

Now, the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
