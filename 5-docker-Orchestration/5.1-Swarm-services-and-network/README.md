**Note**: Notice that the global service is running its instances on all the nodes of the swarm cluster.

### Step 5: Check the status of the replicated service i.e., myweb

```
sudo docker service ps myweb

```

 
**Note**: Notice that the replicated service is running the service replicas on all the nodes of the swarm cluster.

-------------------------

# Lesson 5 Demo 5: Create an Overlay Network 

This section will guide you to: 
- Create an overlay network in a Docker swarm cluster
- Create a replicated service to establish communication between service tasks

### Step 1: Check the network drivers on the manager and worker nodes of the swarm cluster
- On the master tab, list all the networks and check the Driver type of swarm cluster 

```
sudo docker network ls

```

	 
**Note**: Notice that the Driver type of swarm cluster is overlay and its name is ingress.
- Click on the worker1 tab and navigate to the newly opened tab of worker1 node
 
- On worker1 node, list all the networks and check the Driver type of swarm cluster

```
sudo docker network ls

```

**Note**: Notice that the Driver type of swarm cluster is overlay and its name is ingress.
**Note**: Navigate back to the master tab to run commands on manager node

### Step 2: Create an overlay network and run a replicated service on it
- Use the following command to create an overlay network

```
sudo docker network create -d overlay nginx-net1

```

 
- Create a replicated service with five replicas connected to the nginx-net1 network

```
sudo docker service create --name nginx-service1 \
--publish target=80,published=80 --replicas=5 \
--network nginx-net1 nginx

```

 
- List all the service tasks created by the replicated service

```
sudo docker service ls

```

 
- Inspect the nginx-net1 network on manager node and check the Containers section for the service tasks connected to the overlay network from this host

```
sudo docker network inspect nginx-net1

```

 
- Click on the worker1 tab and navigate to the newly opened tab of worker1
- Inspect the nginx-net1 network on worker1 node and check the Containers section for the service tasks connected to the overlay network from this host

```
sudo docker network inspect nginx-net1

```

 
- Click on the worker2 tab and navigate to the newly opened tab of worker2
- Inspect the nginx-net1 network on worker2 node and check the Containers section for the service tasks connected to the overlay network from this host

```
sudo docker network inspect nginx-net1

```

 
**Note**: Navigate back to the master tab to run commands on manager node.
- On the manager node, inspect the replicated service and check the Ports under the Endpoints section

```
sudo docker service inspect nginx-service1

```

 
 
- Run the following command on manager node to clean the replicated service and network:

```
sudo docker service rm nginx-service1


sudo docker network rm nginx-net1
``` 

------------------------------

# Lesson 5 Demo 6: Deploy a Service on an Overlay Network

This section will guide you to: 
- Deploy a service on an overlay network

### Step 1: Create an overlay network and attach a service to it
- On the manager node, create an overlay network called nginx-net1

```
sudo docker network create -d overlay my-overlay
```

- Create a nginx service and attach it to the newly created overlay network

```
sudo docker service create --replicas 3 \
--name my-web --network my-overlay nginx
``` 

### Step 2: List the services and inspect the running service tasks
- List all the running services to check the newly created replicated service

```
sudo docker service ls
 ```
- List the running service tasks deployed on the overlay network

```
sudo docker service ps my-web
 ```
- Inspect the overlay network to check which service tasks are running on the manager node

```
sudo docker network inspect my-overlay
```


-----------------------


# Lesson 5 Demo 7: Run a Container into a Running Service Under Swarm

This section will guide you to: 
- Run a container into a running service under swarm

### Step 1: Run the nginx image as a service in global mode, on each node in the swarm cluster

```
sudo docker service create --mode global \
--publish mode=host,target=80,published=8080 \
--name=nginx nginx:latest
 ```

### Step 2: Create a nginx service running three replica containers on the swarm cluster

```
sudo docker service create \
--name my_web --replicas 3 \
--publish published=5050,target=80 nginx
 
```
### Step 3: Check the status of each container instance running within the service:

```
sudo docker service ps my_web
```
-------------------------


# Lesson 5 Demo 8: Demonstrate Locking in a Swarm Cluster

This section will guide you to: 
- Lock and unlock the swarm cluster in Docker

### Step 1: On the master tab, use the following command to enable auto-locking on the existing swarm cluster

```
sudo docker swarm update --autolock=true
```

**Note**: Make sure you copy the unlock-key and save it for later use.

### Step 2: Restart the docker daemon to check whether the swarm cluster is locked


```
sudo systemctl docker restart

sudo docker service ls
``` 

### Step 3: Unlock the swarm cluster using the unlock-key saved in first ### Step

```
sudo docker swarm unlock
```

**Note**: To enter the unlock key, copy the key to the clipboard and paste in using Ctrl+Shift+V.

### Step 4: Use the following command to view the current unlock key

```
sudo docker swarm unlock-key

```


 

### Step 5: Use the following command to rotate the unlock key

```
sudo docker swarm unlock-key --rotate

```

 
**Note**: It is advisable to rotate the locked swarm’s unlock key on a regular schedule. Make sure you keep a record of the unlock-key to unlock the swarm cluster.

### Step 6: To disable auto-locking on the existing swarm cluster, use the following command:

```
sudo docker swarm update --autolock=false

```

# Lesson 5 Demo 9: Draining the Swarm Node

This section will guide you to: 
- Drain the swarm node in Docker

#### Step 1: List all the active nodes

```

sudo docker node ls

```

 

#### Step 2: Start a replicated service using the redis image

```
sudo docker service create --replicas 3 \
--name redis --update-delay 10s redis:3.0.6

```

 

#### Step 3: Check the tasks assigned to different nodes by the swarm manager

```
sudo docker service ps redis

```

 

#### Step 4: Drain a node that has a task assigned to it

```
sudo docker node update --availability \
drain hostname_Worker1

```

**Note**: Replace hostname_Worker1 with the IP address of your worker1 node. In this case it is ip-172-31-26-147
 

#### Step 5: Inspect the drained node and check the Availability of the node

```
sudo docker node inspect --pretty hostname_Worker1

```

**Note**: Replace hostname_Worker1 with the IP address of your worker1 node. In this case it is ip-172-31-26-147
 

#### Step 6: Check the updated task assignments for the redis service by the swarm manager

```
sudo docker service ps redis

```

 

#### Step 7: Return the drained worker1 node to an active state

```
sudo docker node update --availability \
active hostname_Worker1

```

**Note**: Replace hostname_Worker1 with the IP address of your worker1 node. In this case it is ip-172-31-26-147
 

#### Step 8: Inspect the worker1 node again to see the updated Availability status

```
sudo docker node inspect --pretty hostname_Worker1

```

**Note**: Replace hostname_Worker1 with the IP address of your worker1 node. In this case it is ip-172-31-26-147

```

 

#### Step 2: Check the service tasks assigned to different nodes by the swarm manager

```
sudo docker service ps redis

```

 

#### Step 3: Inspect the redis service in an easily readable format

```
sudo docker service inspect --pretty redis

```
