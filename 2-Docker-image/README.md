   sudo docker pull nginx
2. List all the docker images to check the newly pulled nginx image:
   sudo docker images

### Step 2.3.2: Creating a new container
1. Create a new container from the nginx image:

2. Use the following command to list all the running containers and verify if the container has stopped running:
   sudo docker ps

3. You can start the container again and check the running containers:
   sudo docker start CONTAINER_NAME
   Note: Replace CONTAINER_NAME with the name of the newly created container. In this case CONTAINER_NAME is sweet_brown
   sudo docker ps

### Step 2.3.4: Deleting the container
